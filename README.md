## Homecare Hub Aptitude Test

By Marlie Dueck

Objective: Create a basic web application using Laravel to allow signed-in users to view a list of
products and ‘purchase’ them. 

A demo of this application can be found [here](https://homecare-hub.herokuapp.com).


### Steps to Clone the Project for Development
Homestead is the recommended virtual machine for Laravel development. Follow the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/homestead) to install and configure Homestead.
1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local development environment.

2. Run the following commands to install project packages and dependencies:

        composer install
        npm install
        
3. Create a .env file and set the environment variables. You can find an example .env file for Laravel [here](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/blob/7.x/.env.example).

4. For testing, create a .env.testing file and set the environment variables to connect to the database you plan on using for testing. Also set the APP_* environment variables.
